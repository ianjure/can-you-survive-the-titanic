# Titanic Survivor Prediction &nbsp; [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ianjure/titanic-survivor-prediction/blob/master/Titanic_Survivor_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb)
Let's go back to 1912 and explore the data behind the **Titanic** tragedy. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict if a passenger will survive the incident. We will utilize classification algorithms and processed data to find the best model. After that, we will create a web application that anyone can use to try and test our model with new data inputs.

## Data Overview
We will be using the **[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)** dataset from **Kaggle**, which is semi-clean data that contains passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

## Project Methods
1. **Clean the Data:** Handle missing values, create new features, and process categorical variables.
2. **Explore the Data:** Find meaningful insights and relationships among the variables.
3. **Build the Model:** Train the algorithms and fine-tune the best model.
4. **Deploy the Model:** Build a Streamlit web application to test new data.

## Next Steps
1. Improve the **quality** of the data by creating new and relevant features.
2. Try more **sophisticated** classification models and tuning methods.
