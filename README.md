Letâ€™s travel back to 1912 and dive into the data behind the Titanic tragedy. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the incident. We will employ classification algorithms and processed data to identify the most effective model. Subsequently, we will build a web application that allows users to test the model with new data inputs.

## Data Overview
We will use the **[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)** dataset from **Kaggle**, which is semi-clean and includes passenger information such as name, age, gender, and socio-economic class.

## Project Method
1. **Clean the Data:** Address missing values and process categorical variables.
2. **Explore the Data:** Uncover meaningful insights and relationships among the variables.
3. **Create New Features:** Develop additional relevant features from the existing data.
4. **Build the Model:** Train various algorithms and fine-tune the best-performing model.
5. **Deploy the Model:** Create a web application to test the model with new data.

## Next Steps
* **Enhance** data quality by generating more features.
* **Experiment** with more advanced classification models and tuning techniques.
