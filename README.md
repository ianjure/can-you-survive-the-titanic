# Titanic Survivor Prediction
Let's go back to 1912 and explore the data behind the Titanic tragedy. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict if a passenger will survive the incident. We will utilize classification algorithms and processed data to find the best model. After that, we will create a web application that anyone can use to try and test our model with new data inputs.

# Data Overview
Dataset: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

Features:
* Survival - Did the passenger survive?
* Pclass - Passenger's ticket class
* Sex - Male or Female
* Age - Passenger's age in years
* Sibsp - Number of siblings and spouse aboard the Titanic
* Parch - Number of parents and children aboard the Titanic
* Ticket - Passenger's ticket number
* Fare - Passenger's fare amount
* Cabin - Passenger's cabin number
* Embarked - Passenger's port of embarkation

# Project Method
1. **Clean the Data:** Handle missing values, create new features, and process categorical variables.
2. **Explore the Data:** Find meaningful insights and relationships among the variables.
3. **Build the Model:** Train the algorithms and fine-tune the best model.
4. **Deploy the Model:** Build a Streamlit web application to test new data.

# Next Steps
1. Improve the quality of the data by creating new and relevant features.
2. Try more sophisticated classification models and tuning methods.
